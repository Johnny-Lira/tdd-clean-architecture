# 🧪 TDD Practice with C# and .NET

This repository serves as a **personal space to organize and deepen my studies** in **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** using C# and .NET.

It is built gradually through hands-on practice, code refactoring, and exploration of clean coding principles applied to unit tests.

## 📌 Goals

- Develop fluency with the **Red-Green-Refactor** cycle
- Apply **xUnit** for unit testing and **Moq** for mocking dependencies
- Test-drive real-world scenarios (calculator, CPF validator, shopping cart, etc.)
- Document learning patterns and reflect on test design decisions
- Create reusable and well-structured test cases
